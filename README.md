[Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/Sally-Ng/MLND-Predicting_Boston_Housing_Prices) </br>
Language: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy) </br> 
Skills: Machine Learning, Data Exploration </br>
Built Supervised Machine Learning model to estimate the best selling price of houses in Boston, Massachusetts. Distinguished the Decision Tree model preforms the best with a maximum depth of 4.

[Project 2: Finding Donors for Charity](https://github.com/Sally-Ng/Udacity-Finding_Donors_for_Charity) </br>
Language: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy) </br> 
Skills: Machine Learning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization </br>
Compared the accuracy of the SVM, Decision Tree and Na√Øve Bayes models on distinguishing potential donors. Optimized the model with GridSearchCV and preformed features selection to reduce training time.

[Project 3: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/Sally-Ng/MLND-Creating_Customer_Segments) </br>
Language: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) </br> 
Skills: Machine Learning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization </br>
Created a K-Means clustering model to segment customers based on their spending on varies products. Implemented feature scaling for data normalization and PCA for dimensionality reduction
